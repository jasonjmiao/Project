Airline Satisfaction Analysis
Alan Lee (aml326), Jason Miao (jjm467)

The aviation industry is instrinsic to the functioning of the global economy. Yet, in recent times, airline profit margins have become increasingly slim. With that, more and more airlines are failing and 2019 alone has already seen high profile bankruptices of key airlines. In such a time, there is little margin for error within the aviation industry.

Consequently, we seek to determine: Can we predict airlin customer satisfaction? And, if presented with several options for a orute, which airline would a customer prefer to take and why? We plan to do so by analyzing a data set of all customer reviews from Skytrax, an airline airport review and ranking site. Ultimately, an airline is driven by its customer base. Thus, through this data analysis, we hope to improve the airline industry by learning both what is working and what is not.
