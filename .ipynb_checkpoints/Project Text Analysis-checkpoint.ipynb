My complaint was that the Captain switched on the seatbelt sign shortly after take off and said that the crew were unable to commence their inflight duties as we were expecting some turbulence. After an hour of near perfect flying conditions the seatbelt sign was switched off and the crew commenced the service. It seemed obvious that the crew could just not be bothered and sat in the rear galley chatting and eating.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       " \"BUD-CRL-BUD. A320's are okay especially the new additions to the fleet with a slightly different interior compared to the old ones. It is a usual no-frills airline so I do not have much to say about the FA's. The biggest problem with the airline is that its flights are almost always delayed (or at least on this route). It is usually operated towards mid - to late-afternoon which means delays have already accumulated during the day. I think you are lucky to get away with a 60-120 minute delay on my last CRL-BUD flight I was delayed for over 4 hours.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       " \"BGY-SOF and BBU-BGY. Flight to Sofia delayed half an hour with no remarks shown on the monitors; plane not brand new but acceptable seat pitch and polite crew. Return from Bucharest Baneasa was on time but the boarding hall in this airport is a disgrace being overcrowded with few monitors (very hard to be read) and with no space for more than 250 persons so guess what happens when all the 4 gates are operating at the same time. Besides that it took 40 minutes to get through passport control and security checks. The plane to Bergamo was a new A320 with miserable leg room and hard leather seats. As on the onward trip all the announcements were pronounced so quickly that it was almost impossible to understand what they were talking about. Even the safety announcements were obviously made only because it is compulsory by law since they were just rushing to complete the sentences as soon as possible complying with the short time between bording and departure. When I fly with a low cost carrier I often wonder if the cabin crew would really be able to manage any kind of emergency since I do have the feeling the everything is speeded up to the very limit and this is against safety. It was my first time with this airline and I do not find them to be worse or better than the other major cheap carriers I have been on so far.\"\n",
